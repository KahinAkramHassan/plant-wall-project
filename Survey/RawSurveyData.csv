5/26/2020 19:53:41;Service personal (or subcontractors) visits each plant wall;;;;;;;;Yes;Lamps, Leaf color (with a camera);I don't know;Indoor;My understanding is that remote monitoring of living walls are currently too expensive to make economical sense. When we can send a human to physically look at a wall once a week or every other week (depending on the irrigation system or lack there of), for less a remote system, they just don't make sense. Even if we had a system to monitor the wall remotely, we would still need to have personnel on site at least once per month to trim the plant material and make replacements. (While they are there, they will look over the wall - so the monitoring system might cut out one visit per month, on a bi-weekly cared for wall.) So if I have to pay someone (time & mileage) $40 per visit and this system saves me 1 visit per month, it couldn't cost more than the $40 I would be paying someone (per wall) - or I would just send the human out. If the wall is manually watered (60% of our walls), the human is going to have to be there every week to water, so no remote system would make sense.;;USA

5/26/2020 22:11:59;Service personal (or subcontractors) visits each plant wall;;;;;;;;Yes;I don't know;We monitor some of our walls with a flow sensor that is connected to a Smart Irrigation Controller. So the previous questions should include 'Flow' as an option which is why I chose 'I don't know'. The Smart Controller has the software that comes with the package. It allows for online monitoring and sends alert (via text or email) to our technicians and the onsite facilities. The valves can be controlled remotely with the app. ;Both;Good luck!

While on site our staff perform a range of general horticultural tasks, with the addition of light assessments (Lux mapping), temperature and moisture checks, nutrient assessment, and pest management.

The online monitoring specifically addresses irrigation concerns, including power outage, unexpected flows, or water int interruptions. ";;Australia
